# Drag Test

# Todo
- Why does hs selection not work properly?
- Show 'unselected' as a line. E.g. stuff explicitly selected against
- Show 'context' as subtle colour.
- Show height filter with breaks
- Should be able to select a single segment of the radial display
- Text horizontal
- Text vertical with alignment and height

# Later
- Vertical linear brush
- Direction arrows
